Everything Pythonic

This repository has some stuff that I have developed over time to learn python as well as implement &
fine-tune some algorithms. The code and data here are more a hotch-potch collection of experiments
in learning coding (mostly python), data compression, fine-tuning algorithms, etc.,.

Currently this repo hosts the following:
1. A python implementation of the Yay0 data compression and decompression
2. A python implementation of LZY file compression.
